## Task 1: Loading and Preprocessing the Image
I began by loading an image from the following URL:

![Original Image](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2022/10/28094926/2023-toyota-supra-gt4-evo-2.jpg)

The original image had a shape of (1062, 597, 3), indicating that it is a color image. To make further processing easier, I resized the image to 224x224 pixels.

## Task 2: Grayscale Conversion
In this step, I converted the resized image to grayscale using OpenCV's `cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY` conversion. This resulted in a grayscale image with a shape of (224, 224). Grayscale images are often used in various image processing tasks as they simplify the data to a single channel, making it easier to work with.

## Task 3: Convolution with Random Filters
For this task, I generated 10 random 5x5 filters. Each filter is a matrix of random values. I then applied convolution to the grayscale image using each of these filters, creating feature maps.

Below are visualizations of the filters and their corresponding feature maps:

### Filter 1
![Filter 1](insert_filter1_image_url_here)
- This is the first randomly generated filter.

### Feature Map 1
![Feature Map 1](insert_feature_map1_image_url_here)
- This is the feature map generated by convolving the grayscale image with Filter 1.

### Filter 2
![Filter 2](insert_filter2_image_url_here)
- This is the second randomly generated filter.

### Feature Map 2
![Feature Map 2](insert_feature_map2_image_url_here)
- This is the feature map generated by convolving the grayscale image with Filter 2.

...

Please repeat the above pattern for all 10 filters and their corresponding feature maps.

## Conclusion
In this assignment, I successfully loaded, resized, and converted an image to grayscale. I then applied convolution with random filters and displayed the filter-feature map pairs. This assignment helped me gain a better understanding of image processing techniques and convolutional operations. 

Feel free to replace the placeholders `insert_filterX_image_url_here` and `insert_feature_mapX_image_url_here` with the actual URLs or paths to your filter and feature map images. Additionally, you can add more details, explanations, or any other specific information required for your assignment.
